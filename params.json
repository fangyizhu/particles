{"name":"Particles System","tagline":"","body":"# Particle System by Fangyi Zhu\r\nCross platform runnable application is in git repository. Download and play with it! I don't erase particles while switching between modes to create fun accidents.\r\n## Features Implemented\r\n### (15) Water Fountain \r\n![water](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/water.png)\r\n### (15) Fire Simulation \r\n![fire](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/fire.png)\r\n### (15) Magic Spell \r\n![magic](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/magic.png)\r\n### (10) Gravity \r\n![gravity](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/gravity.png)\r\n### (5) Bouncing on Floor\r\n![bounce](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/bounce.png)\r\n### (5) Snow\r\n![snow](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/snow.png)\r\n### (5) Realtime rendering\r\n60 frames per Second.\r\n```java\r\nframeRate(60);\r\n```\r\n### (5) Interaction with obstacles\r\nA blue box to play with, use up, down, left, right keys to move it around. Particles hit on it will bounce.\r\n![box](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/box1.png)\r\n![box](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/box2.png)\r\n![box](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/box3.png)\r\n![box](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/box4.png)\r\n![box](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/box5.png)\r\n### (5) Tails on particles\r\nParticles in all modes have tails, long or short.\r\n### (5) Translucent particles\r\nFire, magic, snow mode have translucent particles, fire and magic's opacity change with lifetime.\r\n### (10) Real-time user interaction with system\r\n### (10) Multiple interacting particle systems\r\nBy clicking the last dot on up-left, turn on mouse mode. Particles will fly away from the cursor. \r\nCan be played together with the blue box. When moving fast, some particles can be trapped, it's fun.\r\nShowed in video.\r\n### (5) Art Contest Submission\r\n![art](https://raw.github.com/rhodon/particles/master/wiki/contest.png)\r\n### (5) Video documenting your system and highlights features\r\nhttp://youtu.be/3_HirLtTV8k\r\n\r\n## Tools and Libraries\r\n* Processing: http://processing.org/\r\n* Particle system based on example: http://processing.org/\r\n\r\n## Difficulty Encountered\r\nIn mouse mode, when mouse move too fast, some particle would stuck In the invisible circle around the mouse. But I find it actually quite interesting, so I just keep it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
